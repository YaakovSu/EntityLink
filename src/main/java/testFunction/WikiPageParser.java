As founded by its institutional predecessor in 1905 shortly before the end of China's imperial [[Qing dynasty]], it is among the oldest modern universities of the country. Fudan is now composed of four campuses, including Handan ({{lang|zh-hans|邯}}), Fenglin ({{lang|zh-hans|髁}}), Zhangjiang ({{lang|zh-hans|江}}), and Jiangwan ({{lang|zh-hans|江}}). ==History== Fudan, formerly romanized as '''Fuh Tan''', was initially known as Fudan Public School in 1905. The two Chinese characters Fu ({{lang|zh-hans|}}) and Dan ({{lang|zh-hans|旦}}), literally meaning \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\", were chosen by the distinguished educator in modern Chinese history, Father [[Ma Xiangbo]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], from the [[Confucian Classics|Confucian Classic]] ''Shangshu Dazhuan'' ({{zh|s=尚书大传|hp=|links=no}}): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" ({{zh|s=日月光A，旦偷┵|hp=|links=no}}). In 1911 during the [[Xinhai Revolution]] the college was taken up as the headquarters of the [[Guangfu Army]] and closed down for almost one year. The university motto comes from Analects Book 19.6 ({{zh|s=博W而V志,切而近思|hp=|links=no}}), which means \"to learn extensively and adhere to aspirations, to inquire earnestly and reflect with self application\". In 1917, Fudan Public School became a [[private university]] named the Private Fudan University, and also had a [[middle school]] and [[university-preparatory school]]. In 1929, Fudan adjusted its departments, expanded to include the Journalism Department, Municipals Department, Law Department and Education Department, totalling 17 departments devoted to Arts, Science, Law and Business. After the [[Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, Fudan moved with the [[Kuomintang]] government to the inland city of [[Beibei]], [[Chongqing]], the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the [[National Government of the Republic of China|National Government]] of the [[Republic of China]] voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a [[public university]] with [[Wu Nanxuan]] as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to [[Shanghai]]. After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], Fudan lost its \"National\" appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. Fudan was the first university to be adjusted by the new government in 1952 and modelled on [[Soviet education]]. The original departments were changed, and Arts and Science departments from at least ten other universities in eastern China were added. This not only added to basic academic offerings of Fudan, but also gathered many talented academics from [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], [[Anhui]] and [[Shanghai]], including [[Su Buqing]], [[Chen Jiangong]], [[Tan Jiazhen]], and [[Lu Hefu]]. In the 1970s, after the [[Cultural Revolution]], the university was changed to a modern, comprehensive-style university. Fudan University and [[Shanghai Medical University]] were merged on April 27, 2000. ==Institutions== [[File:Fudan-xianghuitang.jpg|thumb|250px|Xianghui Auditorium]] [[File:Fudan-guanghualou.jpg|thumb|250px|Guanghua Twin Towers]] ===Organizations=== Fudan University comprises 17 full-time schools, 69 departments, 73 bachelor's degree programs, 22 disciplines and 134 sub-disciplines authorized to confer Ph.D. degrees, 201 master degree programs, 6 professional degree programs, 7 key social science research centers of Ministry of Education P.R.C, 9 national basic science research and training institutes and 25 post-doctoral research stations. It has 40 national key disciplines granted by the Ministry of Education, nationally third. At present, it has 77 research institutes, 112 cross-disciplinary research institutes and 5 national key laboratories. The [[Shanghai Institute of Visual Art]] (SIVA) is an independent subsidiary of Fudan University.

Fudan University has 10 teaching hospitals, such as Zhongshan Hospital and Huashan Hospital, integrating medical service, medicine education and research. These hospitals have state-of-the-art equipment and sophisticated technology, over 900 highly qualified staff, creating a good environment for medical education. Fudan University has an \"International Student's Dormitory\", a building reserved as living quarters for any students from countries other than China studying either degree or non-degree programs. Notable alumni include Jennifer Chu and Audrey Lamsam of Arcadia, California, who started a nonprofit organisation called \"Food4Me\" in 2012. This organisation first stemmed from their studies as non-degree Chinese students at the university. Fudan is a member of [[Universitas 21]], an international consortium of research-driven universities. Dr. Ren Xiao is the director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Foreign Policy and The Rising Powers Initiative Co-Directors.{{cite web | url=http://www.risingpowersinitiative.org/projects/worldviews/phase1/participants/ | title=The ADIZ imbroglio: A Chinese View | publisher=Sigur Center for Asian Studies | date=December 2013 | accessdate=19 December 2013}} The Guanghua Twin Towers ({{zh|s=光华楼|hp=|links=no}}) standing in the center of the campus reach 140.5 meters, reportedly the highest buildings ever constructed in a university campus in China. The [[High School Affiliated to Fudan University]], located on the Handan campus, is one of the most prestigious high schools in Shanghai. ===Library=== Fudan University Library was formally established in 1922, previously known as the Reading Room of Wu Wu (1918). Today it comprises the Liberal Arts Library, the Science Library and the Medical Library, with a total floor of 29,000 square meters. By the end of 2004, the Library's collection composed of more than 4.4588 million copies and articles, including books, journals, bound volumes of newspapers, and audio-visual recordings. Of all these 400,000 are thread-bound books of Chinese classics (including 7,000 rare copies), 100,000 are books published during the reign of the Republic of China, and 1.392 million are foreign books. Additionally, there are 32,000 Chinese and foreign journals and periodicals. Every year 100,000 new books will be added to enlarge the collection. The library subscribes to around 7,000 printed journals. The library has been undergoing great changes in the resource structure in the recent years. It puts strong emphasis on acquiring diversified types of resources and, as a result, academic e-resources have increased rapidly. Secondary documents that cover all the disciplines of the university are plentiful as well. The library has access to 24,000 full-text e-journals and over 150 CD and online databases. It has eight open stacks, two general reading rooms and 19 reading rooms with specialized functions, totaling 2,400 seats. The library is open for 112 hours weekly and serves more than 7,000 visiting readers daily. Its online services are available 24 hours a day. The Fudan University Library is divided into the China Academic Humanities and Social Sciences Library (CAHSL), the National Foreign Textbook Center for East China (sponsored by the Ministry of Education), the Documentation and Information Center for Liberal Arts, and the Central Stacks for Foreign Books of Liberal Arts. Additionally, the library has the Shanghai Electronic Documents Searching Center for Graduates, the CD Searching Center Shared by the Universities in Northeast Shanghai, and the General Search Station for Updated Science and Technology Information Authorized by the Ministry Of Education, the Search Station for Updated Science and Technology Information Authorized by the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee. The Library edits and publishes two journals: ''China Index'' and ''Information Services of the Higher Education Institutions in Shanghai''. The library's integrated computer management system has been upgraded several times. In addition to general services, the Library provides services of international online information retrieval, various types of e-resources searching, [[interlibrary loan]]s, document delivery service, online consultation, updated information search, user training, tape duplication, multimedia viewing, document duplication and binding, etc. The courses of literature and information retrieval are designed for Library users of different levels. ==Student associations== There are four categories of student associations: Academic Societies, Practical Societies, Artistic Societies, and Physical Culture Societies.

Students from each department (or school) design their own souvenir T-shirts when they graduate.]] Fudan University has been carrying out a profound reform in its undergraduate program, aiming at quality higher education and intending to train more creative talents for the world. The reform begins with the construction of a credit system. Fudan has reconstructed its course system to suit education goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in arts and sciences has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to a wider range of knowledge. ====Graduate program==== The Graduate School of Fudan University was established on November 6, 1984 and the Graduate School of Shanghai Medical University on January 25, 1985. Both were among the first 22 graduate schools after China's universities officially resumed enrolling graduate students. With the merger of Shanghai Medical University and Fudan University in April 2000, the two graduate schools were joined to be a new Graduate School of Fudan University. Therefore, a comprehensive graduate education structure is formed with disciplines in humanities, law, sciences, engineering, medicine and management. ====International students==== Starting from the 1950s, Fudan has enrolled international students ― one of the first few institutions in China to do so. Since then, Fudan has accepted and trained over 10,000 foreign students from 100 countries and regions worldwide. At the end of 2006, there were 2,812 international students studying at Fudan University, ranked number 2 in the nation. Half of them were actively pursuing degrees, the rest were general visiting scholars. In addition, Fudan enrolls over 1700 short-term students each year. The international student programs consist of degree programs and non-degree programs.[http://www.fso.fudan.edu.cn/en/index.htm/ ''Fudan - International students office''] The university has also established a Bachelor of Arts program called the \"Chinese language for international students\" and there have been seven groups of graduates. Besides all levels of Chinese language teaching, the university has opened courses such as Chinese literature, Chinese history, Chinese economy, Chinese philosophy and Chinese law for interested international students. These courses will introduce students to basic knowledge of Chinese social economy, history and culture, according to their different requirements. In addition, several graduate programs are offered in English. For instance [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Public Health]], as well as other programs offered in conjunction with partner universities abroad. The university's programs in medicine leading to the [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] ([[MBBS]]) degree are also available to international students. The [http://www.fso.fudan.edu.cn/en/index.htm International Students Office] is responsible for the management of all international students at Fudan University. ==Reputation and rankings== {{Infobox world university ranking | QS_W = 88 | THE_W = 201-225 | THE_A = 24 | QS_A = 16\n" +

The ''QS World University Rankings'' (2013/14) considered it 88th worldwide while it was 23rd and 4th in the independent regional ''QS Asian University Rankings'' (2013) and ''[[QS BRICS University Rankings]]'' (2013) respectively.{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/brics-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+country=+stars=false+search=|title=QS University Rankings: BRICS|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|date=2013-12-17|accessdate=2013-12-17}} Further, ''ARWU'' (2013) put it at a position among 151-200th globally. It is among the top five universities in [[mainland China]] in all of the above league tables. ==Campus== [[Image:ZibinYuan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Zibinyuan Building at Handan campus]] Fudan has established a campus structure called \"one-body-two-wings\", where the body is Handan (邯) campus and Jiangwan (江) campus, which are only {{convert|2|mi|km}} apart, and the two wings are Fenglin (髁) campus and Zhangjiang (江) campus. All the four campuses are in downtown [[Shanghai]]. ===Handan campus=== Handan campus, the main campus of Fudan, is located in Yangpu District, [[Shanghai]]. It contains the majority of the schools and departments. Freshman undergraduates live in this campus. Handan campus consists of four sub-campuses, namely the headquarters campus, the south campus, the north campus, and the east campus. ===Fenglin campus=== [[Fudan University Shanghai Medical College]], or Medical Center of Fudan University (former [[Shanghai Medical University]]) is at Fenglin campus, located in Xuhui District, [[Shanghai]]. ===Zhangjiang campus=== Zhangjiang campus is located in Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, Pudong District, [[Shanghai]]. It comprises the School of Microelectronics, the School of Computer science and technology, the School of Software, and the School of Pharmacy. This campus lies in the heart of [[Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park]]. ===Jiangwan campus=== Only {{convert|2|mi|km}} apart from Handan campus, Jiangwan campus is a new campus of Fudan University. The School of Law has moved to Jiangwan, and other schools will follow, including the School of Life Science, the College of Foreign Language and Literature, and School of Social Development and Public Policy. ==Notable alumni== Today, associations organized by Fudan's alumni can be found in the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. The inspiring word of Fudan has been impressed deep into the minds of Fudan people. Educationally, academically and economically, Fudan alumni's strengthened ties with their alma mater are playing a significant role in the development of the University. The routine services of these alumni associations include: updating contact lists, holding conferences, conducting Sino-foreign cultural exchanges, and keeping contact with other alumni associations throughout the world. Li Deng-hui, ex-president of Fudan instructed the students to unite, serve and sacrifice. A well-known 77-year-old architect from the Alumni Association in Taipei also said that strength lies in unity and that Fudan alumni are expected to serve as an example in the increasing mergers of higher learning schools in mainland China. A worldwide gathering is held annually in order to promote the relations between the alumni all over the world.

The University is also a member of China Center Austria and partner of the Austrian Business School [[w:de:SMBS - University of Salzburg Business School|SMBS]]. Fudan University is also a member of [[Universitas 21]], which is an association of leading universities worldwide. Universitas 21 grants members of staff and students from the university many exchange chances and opportunities to research abroad. To seek more support from its alumni in the US and cement its collaboration with Yale University, Fudan University launched the Fudan University Education Development Foundation[http://www.fuedf.org/usa/OnlineGiving.aspx/ ''Fudan University Education Development Foundation''] in New York in February 2008. It was the first time a Chinese university had launched such an initiative in the US. In 1995, Fudan established the [[Nordic Centre in Shanghai]], a joint platform for research and education with 14 universities from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. By 2012, the Nordic Centre Fudan has 27 member institutions in 5 [[Nordic countries]].http://www.nordiccentre.org In 1996, Fudan School of Management started a joint Master of Management (later [[MBA]]) program with [[BI Norwegian Business School]]. The program, inaugurated by then Norwegian Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], is the longest continually operating international business school partnership in China. In 2002, a joint venture was created between the [[Olin Business School]] ([[Washington University in St. Louis]]) and the School of Management at Fudan University. At the time, it was one of the first U.S.-Sino joint MBA programs in China. Eight years later, according to The Financial Times' 2010 rankings, the Washington University-Fudan University EMBA Program[http://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/topemba ''Washington University-Fudan University Executive MBA Program''] was ranked as one of the top 20 international executive MBA programs worldwide. Also, for the fifth consecutive year, it was hailed as the best program in mainland China.[http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/emba-rankings-2010 ''Financial Times 2010 EMBA Rankings''] In 2011, Fudan became part of the [[Tyndall Centre]] network, a research network centred on climate science and climate policy research. Fudan Tyndall Centre is funded with a 15 year commitment by the Chinese central government and the Shanghai City government. The UK launch of the Fudan Tyndall Centre alliance took place in Norwich in May 2011 when Professor Academician Yuliang Yang was awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of East Anglia[http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/communication/news-archive/2011/fudan-hub ''Fudan hub of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research''] In Germany, the Fudan University cooperates with the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe-University]] in Frankfurt/Main.

In 1952, the Chinese government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style system, departments from [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|Saint John's University]], [[Zhejiang University]], [[University of Shanghai]], [[Utopia University]], [[Aurora University (Shanghai)|Aurora University]], [[Tongji University]] and [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiaotong University]] were incorporated into ECNU. After the adjustment, ECNU was changed to a comprehensive multi-disciplinary university in China. In March 1959, ECNU was authenticated as one of the first 16 National Key Universities in China, and this status was reaffirmed in 1978. From 1972 to 1980 (the [[Cultural Revolution]] in [[mainland China]]), it was known as Shanghai Normal University, and in 1980 its original name \"ECNU\" was resumed. In June 1986, ECNU was selected to be one of the first 33 higher education institutions authorized, by the State Council, to establish their [[graduate schools]]. In 1996, ECNU passed the prerequisites appraisal and became one of universities sponsored by the major national program \"[[Project 211]]\". In 2006, the Ministry of Education and [[Shanghai]] Municipality signed into a partnership for co-sponsoring the development of the university, qualifying ECNU as a member of the \"[[Project 985]]\" and facilitating ECNU's efforts and progress toward a world-renowned high-level research university.http://lxs.ecnu.edu.cn/EnFront.do?method=findContentByChannel&parentid=58&kidid=353 About ECNU ==Present== [[File:华东师范大学闵行校区图书馆.jpg|thumb|ECNU Library.]] ECNU is a national renowned university under the direct auspices of the Ministry of Education of China and sponsored by the prestigious national program \"[[Project 211]]\" and \"[[Project 985]]\".
